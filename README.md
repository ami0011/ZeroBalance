**Now Clone the repository and install project dependencies -** 

    Create a new directory then open command prompt and set path to the working directory then - 
Run the following command to clone repository

    git clone https://github.com/ami0011/finixDemo.git
Once cloning is done then go to the inner folder
		

    cd finixDemo
then run the following command

	npm install
After successful installation of all dependencies itâ€™s time to run our application.
	Hit `npm start`  then goto [http://locathost:3000](http:loclhost:3000) in your browser.
	
To run the local copy in production mode and build the sources, execute:

    npm run prebuild:prod && npm run build:prod && npm run server:prod

This will clear up your dist folder (where release files are located), generate release build and start built-in server. Now you can copy the sources from a dist folder and use it with any backend framework or simply put it under some web server.
